The 5S genes are found at a single site near the centromere of the second chromosome, whereas the 28 and 18S genes are found at the nucleolar organizer region of the dot chromosome. The dot chromosome has been previously described as \u03b1-heterochromatic. However, our cytochemical and autoradiographic results do not support such a conclusion. The autoradiographic results reveal that the dot chromosome is transcriptionally active and is not late-replicating, as is expected of \u03b1-heterochromatin. Further, the dot chromosomes possess none of the usual staining characteristics of heterochromatin except for its lack of polytene bands. Using rRNA-DNA filter hybridizations, we find that the rDNA of D. tumiditarsus salivary glands is under-replicated. This is the first species of Drosophila where the rDNA in not found on the sex chromosomes, and is the first report of an under-replicated autosomal locus which is not located in heterochromatic blocks.", "url": ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7472021", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7472021", "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF00329578", "http://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00329578.pdf", "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00329578", "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00329578"], "references": ["136c3397-0090-48b7-97c4-4ff5a1174650", "13dfc66f-af31-4b4e-a97f-35b79f37b166", "1c7de4c6-2b23-4f86-8ad2-44612f961b3c", "1ea66af9-dde3-42b1-8e3f-0a99096ffaa6", "25b38ae1-cf8f-4ac7-b2b3-e55b4b841f3e", "265d144e-9b8f-4785-914c-3527a9736c7b", "2c593f5c-4c1d-466b-bdab-fa87d4f3a557", "316de1b5-5560-4163-8004-ed2d7e898b31", "3199ba7d-c42b-46cb-9432-fd1068c0c6c3", "32221277-41a8-4e81-8f76-5a5e6367bb7f", "44a7f802-a5ec-47f4-ace5-6280a2f52810", "4c34357d-dbc1-4bf0-8ea7-3a409dccc7c9", "5badbaa1-3997-47e0-9c2e-060286dd41ba", "608d5043-3d7b-4eea-b797-d1966a6d4d99", "6da69cde-c959-4219-bb2c-dfb5b55c796b", "78816888-ec6f-4c79-9de7-12560319e4af", "83de2cfa-f7f6-4705-be0a-cedb582a5c78", "87e0c3f4-0178-4d2e-81fe-ee9e871f943f", "8e13266e-aac3-41f3-b607-7b2e673aad85", "94f819bb-62a8-4114-b3ad-608e9e0365e7", "9965ed9a-d52f-414c-be59-68de7713fb58", "a0e9e2ff-1344-4f7a-be63-e7e999850c91", "ab2bdf47-b0df-4428-84e8-4c12759f3fe2", "af198607-fd89-43bb-9b32-0320ea4dcd57", "b1b5690f-1a17-4fd0-97c1-27c42ae18373", "b9906af5-2a2e-41d4-a73b-da8db5525d0c", "c6fef8b1-e47f-4de5-b2ff-8dadf72fb0f7", "c86f0887-3b24-47bb-9f2f-ee8df810ff1f", "cd671fd8-b7f0-461f-9424-237abe039255", "ce23ae3d-c0ed-4770-8ffa-c93dc4ac689e", "d0b89fa0-bbb0-4b55-b6e8-d059c039fcfa", "dfcf9320-7ea0-47ff-8c26-8bc29d20bdec", "e6a55b0f-8653-42ef-83f3-f009a1ebfefa", "eac20ec0-4b00-47df-9848-2904281bc5ba", "f16b61c7-63cb-448e-84df-c2721b3f2efd", "f32e9d84-9316-49b2-a0d1-e4f676953eb0", "f4416d2d-3081-4a5e-bcc3-4c2c83df1815", "f74d2604-526a-48b3-9179-376d3f8ccbd9", "f84cc489-0152-4b41-8fe7-1b21d46018f6"], "issue": "5", "id": "f655d4c7-e0ee-4bd8-8ea6-4b41159f2825", "year": 1981, "title": "Localization and characterization of rDNA in Drosophila tumiditarsus", "authors": [{"name": "Ralph M.

One possible strategy for transforming our world from a death-rattle industrial civilization to a life affirming ecological civilization may be found in the later work of Antonio Gramsci. It is argued that as Gramsci became increasingly disillusioned with Soviet communism, he diagnosed its failure as due to the way opposition movements tend to mirror the ways of thinking, practices and organization of those they are opposing. To avoid this tendency, Gramsci called not for a \u2018counter-hegemony\u2019, but an alternative hegemony based on a different conception of the world. The notion of \u2018ecological civilization\u2019 could provide this, offering the foundation for the moral leadership required in a war of position to genuinely overcome and replace existing socio-economic forms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                #R##N# /* Style Definitions */#R##N# table.MsoNormalTable#R##N##TAB#{mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\";#R##N##TAB#mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0;#R##N##TAB#mso-tstyle-colband-size:0;#R##N##TAB#mso-style-noshow:yes;#R##N##TAB#mso-style-priority:99;#R##N##TAB#mso-style-qformat:yes;#R##N##TAB#mso-style-parent:\"\";#R##N##TAB#mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;#R##N##TAB#mso-para-margin:0in;#R##N##TAB#mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt;#R##N##TAB#mso-pagination:widow-orphan;#R##N##TAB#font-size:11.0pt;#R##N##TAB#font-family:\"Calibri\",\"sans-serif\";#R##N##TAB#mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;#R##N##TAB#mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;#R##N##TAB#mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";#R##N##TAB#mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;#R##N##TAB#mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;#R##N##TAB#mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;#R##N##TAB#mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";#R##N##TAB#mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}", "url": ["http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin:33533/SOURCE1", "http://www.cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/352/576", "https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-382085552/towards-an-ecological-civilization-a-gramscian-strategy", "http://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/download/352/576", "http://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/352/576", "http://www.cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/352/0", "http://www.cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/352", "http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/swin:33533", "http://www.cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/352/575", "http://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/352/539"], "references": ["28accb26-b259-465c-81c4-4daf7d055979", "3e6cb4e4-15d9-4fd3-8bf5-c6f583500ecf", "3f3c5a9b-f3e6-4629-a238-8138d4b330dc", "59987144-a51f-4cae-a30c-d78e86e09156", "6a1e0285-b2fe-40d7-985f-9956f03f5303", "6d505635-def6-403b-bb85-5894e28b08fd", "8b9141b5-08e8-49e8-aa64-b53be7924c29", "9084de55-aedb-47a4-a026-d3f2bf40f100", "adcf4d0f-0ecd-4768-80f1-513dc25a5534", "b9458032-2f6d-41fb-b117-8663e20a93c5", "bbe1b29f-b801-4848-9e77-a3c2030667f1", "c2907eae-5f9b-4afc-a4ac-6a18f352d497", "cf300ea6-da52-4da9-9003-ce934ae5acda", "ef914ba5-05c7-43cc-a834-e5e09d45ad98"], "issue": "1", "id": "f655d4f1-bd40-4254-853a-e2796f9f17fa", "year": 2013, "title": "TOWARDS AN ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION: A GRAMSCIAN STRATEGY FOR A NEW POLITICAL SUBJECT", "authors": [{"name": "Gerard Ahearne"}], "page_start": "317", "volume": "9"}
